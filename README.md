# Sales Insights Dashboard

The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive sales dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. This dashboard is built to enable users to visually explore key sales metrics, trends, and insights, empowering them to make data-driven decisions for business growth.

The underlying data for the dashboard was stored in a MySQL database, consisting of multiple interconnected tables. These tables captured critical aspects of the business, such as sales transactions, product details, customer demographics, and regional performance.

The screenshots below offer a glimpse of the final project outcome, showcasing the dynamic and insightful visualizations that help identify sales patterns and opportunities for optimization.
